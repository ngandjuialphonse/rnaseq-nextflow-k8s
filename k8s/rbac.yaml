# Kubernetes RBAC Configuration for Nextflow
# ===========================================
#
# WHAT IS RBAC?
# Role-Based Access Control - defines WHO can do WHAT
#
# WHY DOES NEXTFLOW NEED PERMISSIONS?
# Nextflow dynamically creates and deletes pods for each task in the pipeline.
# Without proper permissions, it can't manage these worker pods.
#
# RBAC COMPONENTS:
# 1. ServiceAccount: Identity (WHO)
# 2. Role: Permissions (WHAT actions on WHAT resources)
# 3. RoleBinding: Connection (WHO can do WHAT)
#
# ============================================================================

---
# 1. SERVICE ACCOUNT
# ==================
# This is the identity that Nextflow will use
#
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: nextflow-sa
  namespace: bioinformatics
  
  labels:
    app: nextflow
    component: orchestrator
  
  annotations:
    description: "Service account for Nextflow pipeline orchestration"
    
    # Optional: Link to AWS IAM role (for EKS with IRSA)
    # eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/nextflow-role
    
    # Optional: Link to GCP service account (for GKE with Workload Identity)
    # iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: nextflow@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# DEVOPS NOTE:
# In production, you might link this ServiceAccount to a cloud IAM role
# to access cloud resources (S3, GCS, etc.) without storing credentials

---
# 2. ROLE
# =======
# Defines WHAT actions are allowed on WHAT resources
#
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: nextflow-role
  namespace: bioinformatics
  
  labels:
    app: nextflow
    component: rbac
  
  annotations:
    description: "Permissions for Nextflow to manage worker pods and access storage"

rules:
  # ============================================================================
  # RULE 1: Pod Management
  # ============================================================================
  # WHY: Nextflow needs to create, monitor, and delete worker pods
  # ANALOGY: Like Jenkins creating build agents
  #
  - apiGroups: [""]  # "" = core API group
    resources: 
      - pods           # The pods themselves
      - pods/log       # Access to pod logs (for monitoring)
      - pods/status    # Check if pods are running/completed/failed
    verbs:
      - get            # Read pod details
      - list           # List all pods
      - watch          # Watch for pod state changes (real-time)
      - create         # Create new worker pods
      - delete         # Delete completed worker pods
      - patch          # Update pod metadata (labels, annotations)
  
  # DEVOPS NOTE:
  # We don't give 'update' permission - pods are immutable once created
  # We use 'patch' only for metadata updates (labels, annotations)
  
  # ============================================================================
  # RULE 2: Pod Execution
  # ============================================================================
  # WHY: Nextflow needs to execute commands in pods (for debugging)
  # ANALOGY: Like SSH access to EC2 instances
  #
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - pods/exec      # Execute commands in running pods
    verbs:
      - create         # Create exec sessions
  
  # DEVOPS NOTE:
  # This is optional but useful for debugging
  # Remove in production if not needed (security)
  
  # ============================================================================
  # RULE 3: Storage Access
  # ============================================================================
  # WHY: Nextflow needs to mount PVCs to worker pods
  # ANALOGY: Like mounting EBS volumes to EC2 instances
  #
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - persistentvolumeclaims  # PVCs for shared data
    verbs:
      - get            # Read PVC details
      - list           # List available PVCs
  
  # DEVOPS NOTE:
  # We only give read permissions - PVCs are created separately
  # Nextflow just needs to reference them when creating pods
  
  # ============================================================================
  # RULE 4: ConfigMaps and Secrets (Optional)
  # ============================================================================
  # WHY: For passing configuration and credentials to worker pods
  # ANALOGY: Like AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
  #
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - configmaps     # Configuration data
      - secrets        # Sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
    verbs:
      - get            # Read config/secrets
      - list           # List available config/secrets
  
  # DEVOPS NOTE:
  # Only include this if your pipeline needs to access ConfigMaps/Secrets
  # For example: API keys for external services, database credentials
  
  # ============================================================================
  # RULE 5: Service Access (Optional)
  # ============================================================================
  # WHY: If worker pods need to communicate with each other
  # ANALOGY: Like service discovery in microservices
  #
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - services       # Kubernetes services
    verbs:
      - get            # Read service details
      - list           # List available services
  
  # DEVOPS NOTE:
  # Only needed if your pipeline has inter-pod communication
  # Most bioinformatics pipelines don't need this

---
# 3. ROLE BINDING
# ===============
# Connects the ServiceAccount to the Role
# Says: "nextflow-sa CAN DO everything in nextflow-role"
#
# DEVOPS ANALOGY:
# Like attaching an IAM policy to a user/role in AWS
#
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: nextflow-rolebinding
  namespace: bioinformatics
  
  labels:
    app: nextflow
    component: rbac
  
  annotations:
    description: "Binds nextflow-sa to nextflow-role"

subjects:
  # WHO: The ServiceAccount that gets the permissions
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: nextflow-sa
    namespace: bioinformatics

roleRef:
  # WHAT: The Role that defines the permissions
  kind: Role
  name: nextflow-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

# DEVOPS NOTE:
# This is a RoleBinding (namespace-scoped)
# For cluster-wide permissions, use ClusterRoleBinding

---
# ============================================================================
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE:
#    Only grant permissions that are actually needed
#    Don't give cluster-admin or wildcard permissions
#
# 2. NAMESPACE ISOLATION:
#    Use Role (not ClusterRole) to limit scope to one namespace
#    This prevents Nextflow from affecting other namespaces
#
# 3. AUDIT LOGGING:
#    Enable Kubernetes audit logs to track what Nextflow does
#    Monitor for suspicious activity (unexpected pod creation)
#
# 4. NETWORK POLICIES:
#    Restrict network access to/from Nextflow pods
#    Only allow necessary communication
#
# 5. POD SECURITY POLICIES/STANDARDS:
#    Enforce security constraints on created pods:
#      - Run as non-root user
#      - Read-only root filesystem
#      - No privileged containers
#      - Drop all capabilities
#
# 6. SECRETS MANAGEMENT:
#    Use external secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)
#    Don't store secrets in ConfigMaps
#    Rotate credentials regularly
#
# 7. RESOURCE QUOTAS:
#    Limit total resources Nextflow can consume
#    Prevent runaway jobs from taking down the cluster
#

# TROUBLESHOOTING RBAC ISSUES
# ============================
#
# SYMPTOM: "Error: pods is forbidden"
# CAUSE: ServiceAccount doesn't have permission to create pods
# FIX: Check that RoleBinding is applied and references correct Role
#
# SYMPTOM: "Error: persistentvolumeclaims is forbidden"
# CAUSE: ServiceAccount can't access PVCs
# FIX: Add PVC permissions to Role (see RULE 3 above)
#
# SYMPTOM: Pods created but can't access storage
# CAUSE: PVC doesn't exist or wrong access mode
# FIX: Check storage.yaml is applied and PVC is ReadWriteMany
#
# SYMPTOM: "Error: serviceaccounts 'nextflow-sa' not found"
# CAUSE: ServiceAccount not created or wrong namespace
# FIX: Apply this file: kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
#
# DEBUGGING COMMANDS:
#   # Check if ServiceAccount exists
#   kubectl get serviceaccount nextflow-sa -n bioinformatics
#   
#   # Check if Role exists
#   kubectl get role nextflow-role -n bioinformatics
#   
#   # Check if RoleBinding exists
#   kubectl get rolebinding nextflow-rolebinding -n bioinformatics
#   
#   # Describe Role (see permissions)
#   kubectl describe role nextflow-role -n bioinformatics
#   
#   # Test permissions (from a pod using the ServiceAccount)
#   kubectl auth can-i create pods --as=system:serviceaccount:bioinformatics:nextflow-sa -n bioinformatics
#   
#   # View all permissions for ServiceAccount
#   kubectl auth can-i --list --as=system:serviceaccount:bioinformatics:nextflow-sa -n bioinformatics

---
# DEVOPS INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS
# ================================
#
# "I implemented RBAC for Nextflow to manage ephemeral pods"
#   - Created ServiceAccount with least-privilege permissions
#   - Limited scope to namespace (not cluster-wide)
#   - Followed security best practices
#
# "I understand the difference between Role and ClusterRole"
#   - Role: namespace-scoped (used here)
#   - ClusterRole: cluster-wide (for cluster-level resources)
#
# "I know how to debug RBAC issues"
#   - Use kubectl auth can-i to test permissions
#   - Check audit logs for forbidden errors
#   - Understand the relationship between SA, Role, and RoleBinding
#
# "I implemented security controls"
#   - Principle of least privilege
#   - Namespace isolation
#   - Resource quotas
#   - Pod security standards
